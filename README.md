Travel to Asia 

This is a website that allows the user to explore 6 major countries in Asia. Each page about said country shows the user muliple cities in the country that are popular or worth visiting. There is a matching description who's purpose is to inform the user about the cities features in a very concise way, if they wish to learn more they can click on the image below the city which will take to them to a travel blog or guide which will give them more information about the city. At the end of the page there is a video as well as a link that both allow the user to dive into the country more. The video gives the user a first hand account of the experiences in that city whereas the link will allow the user to explore more cities within that country so that they can expand their itinerary.

I created this website because I would like to travel and I haven't traveled much outside the United States other that India. I picked Asia because like I stated I have been to India and I figured that since I visit India so often I can travel to other countries in Asia if I am given the opportunity.

I created this website using HTML, CSS, and a little help from AI. The main reason why I used AI was to get an understanding of what cities are the most popular in the country and matching it to websites and when creating the descriptions I wanted some help compiling information without writing a whole essay.

Some errors that I ran into in the beginning stages would be indentation. I couldn't figure out how to indent my paragraphs and images. I thought that I had solved that problem by adding padding under a div and that had in fact worked until I started to add borders and text box backgrounds. That's when I went and researched some and realized that I would have to use margin instead of padding because padding simply added extra space left, right, up, down whereas margin actually moved the element.

Something that I learned when making this website would be how to import fonts since the fonts that already exsisted on VS Code didn't match the vibes that I wanted the page to give off. I used Google Fonts to import fonts and that made it easy to find fonts that matched the country that I was making the page for.
